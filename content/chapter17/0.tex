The \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format}{formatting library} in C++20 provides a safe and extensible alternative to the printf family and extends the Input and Output streams. The library requires the <format>, and the format string syntax follows the Python syntax.

Thanks to the formatting library, you can specify format specifications using a format string for

\begin{itemize}
\item 
the fill character and alignment of text.

\item 
the sign, the width, and the precision of numbers.

\item 
the data type.
\end{itemize}
