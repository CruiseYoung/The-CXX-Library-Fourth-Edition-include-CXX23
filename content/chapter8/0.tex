On the one hand, \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/iterator}{iterators} are generalizations of pointers representing positions in a container. On the other hand, they provide powerful iteration and random access in a container.

Iterators are the glue between the generic containers and the generic algorithms of the Standard Template Library.

Iterators support the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
*: returns the element at the current position

\item 
==, !=: compares two positions

\item 
=: assigns a new value to an iterator
\end{itemize}

The range-based for-loop uses the iterators implicitly.

Because iterators are not checked, they have the same issues as pointers.

\begin{cpp}
std::vector<int> verc{1, 23, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5};
std::deque<int> deq;

// Start iterator bigger than end iterator
std::copy(vec.begin()+2, vec.begin(), deq.begin());

// Target container too small
std::copy(vec.begin(), vec.end(), deq.end());
\end{cpp}
