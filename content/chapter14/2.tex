To make this chapter concise and avoid repeating the detailed descriptions from the chapter on strings, I only mention the non-modifying operations of the string view. Please use the link to the associated documentation in the string chapter for further details.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Element access: operator[], at, front, back, data (see string: element access)

\item
Capacity: size, length, max\_size, empty (see string: size versus capacity)

\item
Find: find, rfind, find\_first\_of, find\_last\_of, find\_first\_not\_of, find\_last\_not\_of (see
string: search)

\item
Copy: copy (see string: conversion between a C++-string and a C-String)
\end{itemize}
