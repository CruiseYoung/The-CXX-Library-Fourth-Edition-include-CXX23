The idea of the book is relatively easy to paraphrase: “What every professional C++ programmer should know about the C++ standard library.” Because of this intention, I left many answers unanswered; therefore, I provide you with the links to the details at the beginning of each new topic.

The link will refer to the excellent online resource \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/}{www.cppreference.com}.
