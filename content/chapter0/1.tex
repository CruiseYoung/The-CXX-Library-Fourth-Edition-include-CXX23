The book should be a reference for C++ and should, therefore, have an index. Leanpub does not support the creation of an index. So Iâ€™ve made it based on regular expressions, naming conventions, a lot of python magic, and a long table that I had to split for each page. Here is the problem. The index is only fully available in the pdf format of the book.
