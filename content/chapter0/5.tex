Iâ€™ve worked as a software architect, team lead, and instructor since 1999. In 2002, I created companyintern meetings for further education. I have given training courses since 2002. My first tutorials were about proprietary management software, but I began teaching Python and C++ soon after. I like to write articles about C++, Python, and Haskell in my spare time. I also like to speak at conferences. I publish weekly on my English blog \href{https://www.modernescpp.com/}{Modernes Cpp}, and the \href{https://www.grimm-jaud.de/index.php/blog}{German blog}, hosted by Heise Developer.

Since 2016, I have been an independent instructor giving seminars about modern C++ and Python.
I have published several books in various languages about modern C++ and, in particular, about concurrency. Due to my profession, I always search for the best way to teach modern C++.
