First, I want to thank Alexandra Follenius, the lector at Oâ€™Reilly, for the German book \href{http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9783955619688.do}{C++ Standardbibliothek}. The German book is the ancestor of this book. For my book C++ Standardbibliothek Karsten Ahnert, Guntram Berti, Dmitry Ganyushin, Sven Johannsen, Torsten Robitzki, Bart Vandewoestyne, and Felix Winter were very valuable proofreaders. A lot of thanks to all of them.

I started a request in my English blog for translating this book to English \href{http://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/do-you-wan-t-to-proofread-a-book}{www.ModernesCpp.com}. I received a much higher response than I expected. Special thanks to all of you, including my son Marius, the first proofreader.

Here are the alphabetically ordered names: Mahesh Attarde, Rick Audet, Pete Barrow, Michael BenDavid, Dave Burns, Alvaro Fernandez, Juliette Grimm, George Haake, Clare Macrae, Arne Mertz, Ian Reeve, Jason Turner, Bart Vandewoestyne, Ivan Vergiliev, and Andrzej Warzynski.
