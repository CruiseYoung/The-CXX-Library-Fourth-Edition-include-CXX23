The C++ Standard Library is a quick reference to the standard library of the current C++23 standard ISO/IEC 14882:2023ยน. C++23 has more than 2100 pages and follows the big C++20 standard. In contrast, C++23 and C++17 are neither a big nor small C++ standards. C++14 is a small addition to C++11.
C++11 had more than 1,300 pages and was published in 2011. That was 13 years after the first and only C++ standard, C++98. Of course, there is also C++03, published in 2003. But C++03 is considered a bug-fix release.

This quick reference aims is to provide a concise reference to the C++ standard library. This book assumes that you are familiar with C++. If so, you will get the most benefit out of this book. If C++ is new to you, you should start with a textbook about core C++. Once you have mastered a book about the core language, you can make your next big step by reading this book. To make your job easier, I have provided many short code snippets to connect theory and practice.
