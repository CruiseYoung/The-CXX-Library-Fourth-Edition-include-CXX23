The + operator is overloaded for strings, so you can add strings.

\begin{myWarning}{The + operator is only overloaded for C++-strings}
The C++ type system permits it to concatenate C++ and C strings to C++-strings, but not to concatenate C++ and C strings to C strings. The reason is that the + operator is overloaded for C++-strings. Therefore only the second line is valid C++ because the C is implicitly converted to a C++-string:
	
\filename{String Concatenation}

\begin{cpp}
// stringComparisonAndConcatenation.cpp
...
#include <string>
...
std::string wrong= "1" + "1"; // ERROR
std::string right= std::string("1") + "1"; // 11
\end{cpp}
\end{myWarning}
