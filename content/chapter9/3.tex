\href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda}{Lambda functions} provide in-place functionality. Lambda functions can receive their arguments by value or by reference. They can capture their environment by value, reference, and with C++14 by move. The compiler gets a lot of insight and has excellent optimization potential.

\begin{cpp}
std::vector<int> myVec{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
std::for_each(myVec.begin(), myVec.end(), [](int& i){ i= i*i; });
									// 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100
\end{cpp}

\begin{myTip}{Lambda functions should be your first choice}
	
If the functionality of your callable is short and self-explanatory, use a lambda function. A lambda function is, in general, faster and easier to understand.
