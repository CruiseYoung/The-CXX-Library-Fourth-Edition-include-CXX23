Utilities are valuable tools that you can use in different contexts. They are not bound to a specific domain. That sentence is valid for the functions and libraries of this chapter. I present functions you can apply to arbitrary values or functions you can use to create new functions and bind them to variables. You can store any value of an arbitrary type in pairs and tuples or build references of any value. Smart pointers are your tool for implementing automatic memory management in C++. To get type information, use the type-traits library.
