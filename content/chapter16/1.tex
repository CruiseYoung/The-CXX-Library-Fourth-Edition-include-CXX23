\noindent
\textbf{basic\_streambuf<>}

Reads and writes the data.

\noindent
\textbf{ios\_base}

Properties of all stream classes independent of the character type.

\noindent
\textbf{basic\_ios<>}

Properties of all stream classes dependent on the character type.

\noindent
\textbf{basic\_istream<>}

Base for the stream classes for the reading of the data.

\noindent
\textbf{basic\_ostream<>}

Base for the stream classes for the writing of the data.

\noindent
\textbf{basic\_iostream<>}

Base for the stream classes for the reading and writing of the data.\\

The class hierarchy has type synonyms for the character types char and wchar\_t. Names not beginning with w are type synonyms for char; names beginning with w for wchar\_t.

The base classes of the class std::basic\_iostream<> are virtually derived from std::basic\_ios<>, therefore std::basic\_iostream<> has only one instance of std::basic\_ios.
