C++ has eight different \href{http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container}{associative containers}. Four associative containers with sorted keys: std::set, std::map, std::multiset, and std::multimap. The other four are associative containers with unsorted keys: std::unordered\_set, std::unordered\_map, std::unordered\_multiset, and std::unordered\_multimap. The associative containers are special containers. That means they support all of the operations described in the chapter Interface of all containers.
